# PHASE 0: BEFORE ANY CODE (Week 0)

**Timeline:** 3-5 days  
**Purpose:** Foundation documents that define scope and enable vibe coding

## Documents to Create (9 total)

---

## 1. PRODUCT_ONE_PAGER.md

**Purpose:** Single source of truth. Prevents scope creep.

**Page Limit:** 1 page max

### Contents:

```markdown
# ReviewFlow: AI Review Management Platform

## Who Uses It
- Local businesses (restaurants, retail, services) managing Google/Yelp reviews
- E-commerce brands managing Shopify/Amazon/Trustpilot reviews  
- Multi-location businesses managing reviews across 10-100+ locations
- Service providers managing client feedback

Target: SMBs with 50-2,000 reviews/month, currently spending 5-20 hours/week on manual responses.

## Core Loop
1. Reviews arrive (manual paste, CSV upload, or API sync)
2. AI generates brand-aligned response in review's language
3. User edits (optional) and approves
4. User posts to platform (manual copy-paste or API)

Time: 100 reviews → 30 minutes instead of 5 hours

## Differentiation
1. **Brand Voice Memory**: Learns from every edit, gets smarter over time
2. **Multi-Language Native**: Responds in 20+ languages automatically
3. **Bulk Workflows**: Process 100+ reviews at once
4. **Platform Agnostic**: Works with ANY review platform via CSV
5. **AI-First**: Built for AI from day 1, not bolted on

## Success Metrics
Primary: Responses posted per workspace per week
Secondary: 
- Edit rate (lower = AI learning)
- Time saved per user per week
- Response time (review received → posted)
- User retention (week 4 active users)

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Review collection/solicitation
- Review widgets
- Advanced analytics
- Team collaboration
- White labeling
- Mobile app
```

---

## 2. PRD_MVP_PHASE1.md

**Purpose:** Define ruthlessly minimal scope for weeks 1-2.

**Page Limit:** 2-3 pages max

### Contents:

```markdown
# PRD: MVP Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)

## Scope
Build ONLY the core response generation loop. Prove AI quality.

## Features IN SCOPE

### F1: Manual Review Input
- User pastes review text into form
- Select platform (dropdown: Google, Shopify, Amazon, Other)
- Select rating (1-5 stars)
- Optional: reviewer name, date
- Save to database
- Validation: Review text required (10-2000 chars)

### F2: AI Response Generation
- Click "Generate Response" on any review
- System detects language automatically (20+ languages)
- AI generates response in same language
- Uses brand voice profile
- Shows response in <5 seconds
- Display: generated text, language detected, tokens used, cost
- Store: generated text, metadata, timestamps

### F3: Brand Voice Learning
- One-time setup form:
  - Brand name (required)
  - Industry dropdown (10 options)
  - Tone slider: Formal ←→ Casual
  - Personality: Professional / Friendly / Playful / Luxury
  - Do's list (0-5 items): "Always mention free shipping"
  - Don'ts list (0-5 items): "Never use exclamation marks"
- Save to database
- Load on every AI generation
- Update when user edits AI response

### F4: Response Editor
- Edit AI-generated text
- Character counter
- Copy to clipboard button
- Save as draft
- Mark as approved
- Track: was_edited (boolean)

### F5: Multi-Language Support (Automatic)
- Detect review language on input
- Generate response in same language
- Support: EN, DE, FR, ES, IT, PT, NL, PL, JA, ZH, AR, RU, KO, SV, DA, FI, NO, TR, HI, BN
- Display language flag in UI
- Optional: Override language (dropdown)

### F6: Usage Tracking
- Track per user:
  - Reviews processed this month
  - Responses generated
  - API cost (cents)
  - Tokens used
- Display in dashboard
- Enforce free tier limit (50 reviews/month)

## Features EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE
❌ CSV import (Phase 2)
❌ API integrations (Phase 3+)
❌ Email forwarding (Phase 3+)
❌ Bulk actions (Phase 2)
❌ Analytics dashboard (Phase 3)
❌ Team features (Phase 4+)
❌ Review collection (Phase 5+)
❌ Stripe billing (Phase 2)

## Success Criteria
- User can paste 10 reviews, generate responses, edit, export in <15 minutes
- AI responses rated 4+ stars by users (user feedback prompt)
- Edit rate <30% (means AI is good enough)
- Zero data loss
- Zero credential leaks
- GDPR compliant

## Non-Goals
- Perfect UI polish (functional > beautiful)
- Advanced error recovery (basic errors OK)
- Performance optimization (works for 1 user)
- SEO (no public pages yet)

## Technical Constraints
- Max 200 tokens per AI response (cost control)
- 5 second timeout on AI calls
- Manual review input only (no integrations)
- Single workspace per user (multi-workspace in Phase 4)

## Risks
1. AI quality varies by language → Test 5+ languages before launch
2. Cost per review too high → Monitor actual costs daily
3. Brand voice learning doesn't work → Start with simple examples
4. Users want CSV immediately → Add to Phase 2 roadmap

## Launch Checklist

- [ ] Privacy policy published
- [ ] Terms published
- [ ] Cookie consent banner
- [ ] GDPR: Data export works
- [ ] GDPR: Account deletion works
- [ ] Free tier limits enforced

# PRD: CSV Import (Phase 2)

## Scope
Allow users to upload CSV files containing reviews from any platform.

## User Story
As a user with 100 Amazon reviews, I want to upload a CSV export so I can generate responses in bulk.

## Features IN SCOPE

### F1: CSV Upload
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Or click to browse
- Support: .csv, .tsv files
- Max file size: 10 MB
- Max rows: 10,000 reviews

### F2: Format Auto-Detection
Detect common formats:
- Amazon Seller Central export
- Trustpilot export
- Google Business export
- Generic (user maps columns)

Auto-map columns:
- Review text → required
- Rating (1-5) → required
- Reviewer name → optional
- Date → optional
- Product name → optional
- Platform → auto-detect or ask user

### F3: Validation & Preview
After upload:
1. Parse file
2. Show preview (first 10 rows)
3. Show summary:
   - Total reviews: 247
   - Valid: 245
   - Invalid: 2 (missing rating)
   - Duplicates: 5 (already in system)
4. User confirms or cancels

### F4: Import Process
- Create "import batch" (trackable)
- Process reviews in batches of 100
- Show progress bar
- Handle errors gracefully (partial success OK)
- Show summary:
  - Imported: 240 reviews
  - Skipped: 5 duplicates
  - Failed: 2 invalid rows

### F5: Post-Import Actions
- Navigate to review list (filtered to this batch)
- Option: "Generate All Responses" (bulk action)
- Option: "Export Results" (after generating)

## Features OUT OF SCOPE
❌ Excel files (.xlsx) - convert to CSV first
❌ Real-time sync - manual upload only
❌ Scheduled imports
❌ Import from URL

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can upload 100-row CSV and see all reviews imported
- [ ] Duplicate reviews are skipped
- [ ] Invalid rows are reported clearly
- [ ] Progress bar shows accurate progress
- [ ] User can cancel import mid-process
- [ ] Imported reviews are tagged with batch ID

## Risks
1. Large files may timeout
   - Mitigation: Process async, show progress
2. Unknown CSV formats
   - Mitigation: Generic mapping UI
3. Database write performance
   - Mitigation: Batch inserts (100 at a time)
```

# PRD: Google Business Profile Integration

## Scope
Connect to Google Business Profile, sync reviews, post responses.

## User Story
As a local business owner, I want to auto-sync my Google reviews so I don't have to manually copy-paste them.

## Prerequisites
- User must have Google Business Profile account
- User must have location(s) set up
- User must grant OAuth permissions

## Features

### F1: OAuth Connection
- "Connect Google Business" button
- OAuth flow to Google
- Request permissions:
  - `business.manage` (read + write reviews)
- Store encrypted tokens

### F2: Location Selection
- After OAuth, fetch user's locations
- User selects which location(s) to sync
- Support 1-100 locations
- Multi-location = separate Integration record each

### F3: Initial Sync
- On first connection, sync last 90 days of reviews
- Show progress: "Syncing 47 reviews from Joe's Pizza..."
- Handle duplicates (skip)
- Tag with integration source

### F4: Incremental Sync
- Every 15 minutes (Vercel Cron)
- Fetch new reviews only
- Update existing reviews if edited
- Handle deleted reviews (soft delete)

### F5: Post Responses
- "Post to Google" button on approved response
- Call Google API to post reply
- Handle errors gracefully
- Update status to "POSTED"

## Features OUT OF SCOPE
❌ Auto-post (user must approve first)
❌ Edit posted responses (Google doesn't allow)
❌ Delete reviews (only Google can)
❌ Review insights/analytics (Phase 4)

## Google API Details

**Endpoints:**
- Auth: `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth`
- Token: `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`
- List Reviews: `GET /v1/accounts/{accountId}/locations/{locationId}/reviews`
- Post Reply: `PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/locations/{locationId}/reviews/{reviewId}/reply`

**Rate Limits:**
- 600 requests per minute per project
- Mitigation: Our sync is <10 requests per location per sync

**Errors to Handle:**
- 401: Token expired (refresh)
- 403: Insufficient permissions (re-auth)
- 429: Rate limited (backoff)
- 404: Review deleted (soft delete)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can connect Google account
- [ ] User can select location(s)
- [ ] Initial sync imports all reviews
- [ ] Incremental sync catches new reviews within 15 minutes
- [ ] User can post response to Google
- [ ] Posted responses show on Google Business Profile

## Risks
1. Google OAuth approval process may take weeks
   - Mitigation: Apply early, use test credentials for dev
2. Rate limits on high-traffic accounts
   - Mitigation: Batch requests, implement backoff
3. User has 100+ locations
   - Mitigation: Limit to 10 locations in MVP

# Data Mapping: Google Business Profile

## Review Fields

### Google → Our Schema

| Google Field | Our Field | Transformation | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| `name` | `externalId` | Direct | "accounts/123/locations/456/reviews/789" |
| `comment` | `reviewText` | Direct | Full review text |
| `starRating` | `rating` | Map | "FIVE" → 5, "FOUR" → 4, etc. |
| `reviewer.displayName` | `reviewerName` | Direct | May be "A Google User" if anonymous |
| `createTime` | `reviewDate` | Parse ISO | "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z" → Date object |
| `updateTime` | `updatedAt` | Parse ISO | Track if review was edited |
| `reviewReply.comment` | Check existence | If exists, skip import | Already has response |

### Star Rating Mapping
```typescript
const GOOGLE_RATING_MAP = {
  'ONE': 1,
  'TWO': 2,
  'THREE': 3,
  'FOUR': 4,
  'FIVE': 5,
};
```

## Reply Fields

### Our Schema → Google

| Our Field | Google Field | Transformation | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| `finalText` | `comment` | Direct | Max 4096 chars |

## Edge Cases

### Anonymous Reviewers
- Google provides: "A Google User"
- Store as-is in `reviewerName`

### Edited Reviews
- Google provides `updateTime`
- Check if `updateTime` > `createTime`
- Update our `reviewText` if changed

### Deleted Reviews
- Google returns 404 on fetch
- Soft delete in our database

### Reviews Without Text
- Some reviews have only rating, no text
- Store with `reviewText` = "" (empty string)
- Don't auto-generate response (no context)

## Example Data

### Google API Response
```json
{
  "name": "accounts/123/locations/456/reviews/789",
  "reviewer": {
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "profilePhotoUrl": "https://..."
  },
  "starRating": "FIVE",
  "comment": "Great service! Fast delivery.",
  "createTime": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updateTime": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Our Database Record
```typescript
{
  id: "clx1234567890",
  userId: "user_abc123",
  platform: "GOOGLE_BUSINESS",
  externalId: "accounts/123/locations/456/reviews/789",

## Delete Flows

### User-Initiated Delete (Soft Delete)
1. User clicks "Delete Review"
2. Set `deletedAt = now()`
3. Hide from UI immediately
4. Hard delete after 30 days

### Automated Delete (Hard Delete)
1. Cron job runs daily
2. Find soft-deleted items >30 days old
3. Hard delete from database
4. Irreversible

## Export Flows

### Full Data Export
```typescript
// GET /api/gdpr/export-data
async function exportUserData(userId: string) {
  const data = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
    include: {
      reviews: true,
      responses: true,
      brandProfile: true,
      integrations: {
        select: {
          platform: true,
          status: true,
          createdAt: true,
          // NEVER export tokens
        }
      },
      usage: true,
      auditLogs: true,
    }
  });
  
  // Return as JSON
  return JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
}
```

### Partial Export
Allow user to export:
- All reviews (CSV)
- All responses (CSV)
- Audit logs (CSV)

## Legal Request Handling

### Law Enforcement Requests
1. Receive request via security@reviewflow.com
2. Verify legitimacy (legal team)
3. Extract requested data
4. Log access
5. Respond within legal timeframe (varies by jurisdiction)

### GDPR Requests from Review Subjects
If someone whose review is in our system requests deletion:
1. They must contact the platform (Google, Amazon, etc.)
2. We sync deletion from platform
3. If they contact us directly, explain process
4. Do NOT delete without platform deletion (could violate TOS)

## Data Breach Response

### Detection
[Monitoring alerts]

### Response Steps
1. Contain breach (disable affected feature)
2. Assess scope (what data, how many users)
3. Notify affected users within 72 hours (GDPR requirement)
4. Notify authorities if >10,000 users affected
5. Post-mortem and remediation

### Notification Template

# Jobs & Failure Handling: Shopify

## Initial Backfill

### When User First Connects
1. Fetch last 90 days of reviews
2. Process in batches of 100
3. Show progress to user
4. Handle failures gracefully

### Implementation
[Code for backfill job]

## Incremental Sync

### Frequency
Every 15 minutes (Vercel Cron)

### Process
1. Check last sync timestamp
2. Fetch reviews since then
3. Upsert to database
4. Update last sync timestamp

### Implementation
[Code for incremental sync]

## Retry Logic

### Transient Failures
Retry with exponential backoff:
- 1st retry: 1 second
- 2nd retry: 2 seconds
- 3rd retry: 4 seconds
- Give up after 3 retries

### Persistent Failures
After 5 consecutive sync failures:
- Mark integration as ERROR
- Email user
- Disable auto-sync
- User must re-authorize

## Reconciliation

### Daily Full Sync
Once per day, fetch all reviews to catch:
- Edited reviews
- Deleted reviews
- Missed updates

### Implementation
[Code for reconciliation]

## Monitoring

### Metrics
- Sync success rate
- Sync duration
- Reviews synced per sync
- Failure rate by error type

### Alerts
- Sync failures >10% → Slack
- Sync duration >5 minutes → Investigate

# Security & Privacy Addendum: Shopify

## Personal Data Inventory

### Data We Receive from Shopify
- Review text (may contain PII)
- Reviewer name
- Reviewer email (if collected)
- Product name
- Order ID

### Data We Store
All of the above, encrypted at rest in Supabase

### Data We Share
Review text sent to Anthropic for AI generation

## Retention Rules

### Shopify-Sourced Reviews
Follow same retention as other reviews:
- FREE: 90 days
- PAID: Unlimited

### When User Disconnects Shopify
- Stop syncing immediately
- Keep existing reviews (they still own this data)
- User can manually delete if desired

## Deletion Propagation

### When User Deletes Review in Our App
- Delete from our database
- Do NOT delete from Shopify (we can't)

### When Review Deleted on Shopify
- Detect on next sync (404 error)
- Soft delete in our database
- Hard delete after 30 days

## Subprocessor Handling

### Judge.me
- Judge.me is the review app on Shopify
- We integrate with Judge.me API, not Shopify directly
- Judge.me is a separate subprocessor

### Data Flow

3. **Assess** (severity, scope, impact)
4. **Communicate** (status page, users)
5. **Mitigate** (temporary fix)
6. **Resolve** (permanent fix)
7. **Post-mortem** (within 48 hours)

## Third-Party Outages

### Anthropic API Down
**Symptoms:** AI generation fails
**Mitigation:**
- Show user-friendly error
- Queue failed generations
- Retry when service restores
- Don't charge user for failed attempts

### Google API Down
**Symptoms:** Can't sync Google reviews
**Mitigation:**
- Disable sync temporarily
- Queue sync for later
- Show status on integrations page
- Email users when restored

### Supabase Down
**Symptoms:** Can't access database
**Mitigation:**
- Show maintenance page
- No mitigation possible (critical dependency)
- Escalate to Supabase support

### Vercel Down
**Symptoms:** App unreachable
**Mitigation:**
- No mitigation possible (critical dependency)
- Escalate to Vercel support
- Consider multi-cloud in future

## AI Degradation Mode

### If AI Quality Drops
**Symptoms:** User reports AI responses are bad
**Actions:**
1. Check AI model version (did Anthropic update?)
2. Check prompt changes (recent deployments?)
3. Review quality metrics
4. Rollback if needed
5. A/B test improvements

### If AI Costs Spike
**Symptoms:** Cost per review >$0.02
**Actions:**
1. Check for prompt caching issues
2. Check token usage (are prompts too long?)
3. Implement aggressive caching
4. Consider cheaper model for some languages

# Documentation Principles (Summary)

## When to Create a Doc

**Create when:**
- About to introduce new risk (CSV → scale risk)
- About to ship new integration (API → trust risk)
- About to add team features (permission → security risk)

**Don't create when:**
- Just brainstorming ideas
- Feature is in "someday/maybe"
- No clear implementation timeline

## When to Update a Doc

**Update when:**
- Scope changes
- Schema changes
- Prompts change
- Security requirements change

**Don't update when:**
- Just fixing typos (unless critical)
- Minor code refactors
- UI polish

## Doc Quality Standards

**Good docs:**
- Specific (not "handle errors" but "retry 3 times with exponential backoff")
- Code examples included
- Acceptance criteria clear
- Risks identified

**Bad docs:**
- Vague ("build integration")
- No code examples
- No success criteria
- Risks ignored

## Version Control

**All docs should be:**
- In Git (alongside code)
- Versioned (update "Last Modified" date)
- Reviewed before major changes
- Referenced in PRs

---
